# This function converts an angle, in degrees, with 0 degrees representing north and increasing anticlockwise
# into a 2D vector representation of X and Y
define function AngleToVector with parameters ANGLE:

	# In maths, tangent of an angle is equal the opposite side length / adjacent side length
	# of a right angled triangle from the angle. By starting from the origin, drawing a
	# right angled triangle with our given angle allows the opposite side to be horizontal (X)
	# and the adjacent side to be (Y). Since we set Y to 1, the angle's tangent would be X/1 = X.
	set X to tan(ANGLE)
	set Y to 1
	
	# Between 90 and 270 degrees, the angle is pointing downwards, so the Y value must be negative
	if ANGLE > 90 or ANGLE < 270:
		
		set Y to -1

	VECTOR = (X, Y)
	return VECTOR
