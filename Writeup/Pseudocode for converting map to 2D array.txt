# A 2D array variable is defined that represents the game map regarding
# whether each tile is empty or is a wall
set MAZE to a 2D array of integers with a size corresponding to the actual game map's size

# Loops through each index of MAZE
for each ROW in MAZE:

	for each COLUMN in MAZE:

		# Checks tile of specified row and column position on the actual map
		# If it is a wall, set value to 1, otherwise set to 0
		if tile in actual game map with the current ROW and COLUMN is a wall:

			set MAZE[COLUMN, ROW] to 1

		else:

			set MAZE[COLUMN, ROW] to 0
