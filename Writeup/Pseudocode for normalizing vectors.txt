# Normalizes a 2D vector by changing its magnitude to 1
# while keeping the ratio of X and Y constant
define function Normalize with parameters X,Y

	# Uses the 2D distance formula to obtain the magnitude of the current vector
	set MAGNITUDE to square root of (x^2 + y^2)

	# Divides the individual X and Y components by the magnitude of the vector
	# This scales the vector in a way that causes its new magnitude to always be equal 1
	set X to X / MAGNITUDE
	set Y to Y / MAGNITUDE

	return X, Y
